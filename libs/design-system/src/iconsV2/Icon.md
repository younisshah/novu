# Icon

## Plan

This directory, `iconV2`, will be moved renamed to `icons` once we remove all the older Icons from the design system. They have all been marked as deprecated in the meantime.

## Background

This group of icons comes from the Material Icons by means of the [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/icons/md/) package.

### A11y Context

`title` is mandatory to ensure that we are acknowledging a11y as a priority.

## Use

To use an Icon, simply use the [react-icons docs](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/icons/md/) for names with "Icon" as a prefix instead of "Md". Alternatively, you can refer to our Storybook!

E.g. instead of using `<Md10k />`, use `<Icon10k />`

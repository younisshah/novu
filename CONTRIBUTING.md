# Contributing to Novu

Thank you for showing an interest in contributing to Novu! All kinds of contributions are valuable to us. In this guide, we will cover how you can quickly onboard and make your first contribution.

## Submitting an issue

Before submitting a new issue, please search the existing [issues](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/issues). Maybe an issue already exists and might inform you of workarounds. Otherwise, you can give new information.

While we want to fix all the [issues](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/issues), before fixing a bug we need to be able to reproduce and confirm it. Please provide us with a minimal reproduction scenario using a repository or [Gist](https://gist.github.com/). Having a live, reproducible scenario gives us the information without asking questions back & forth with additional questions like:

- 3rd-party libraries being used and their versions (mainly providers, but not exclusively)
- a use-case that fails

Without said minimal reproduction, we won't be able to investigate all [issues](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/issues), and the issue might not be resolved.

You can open a new issue with this [issue form](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/issues/new).

## Projects setup and Architecture

### Requirements

- Node.js v20.8.1 (LTS)

  - To install Node.js v20.8.1 (LTS) through NVM (Node Version Manager), follow these steps:

    1. Open your terminal.

    2. Install NVM if you haven't already. You can install NVM by following the instructions at [NVM GitHub](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

    3. Once NVM is installed, run the following command to install and use Node.js v20.8.1:

       ```bash
       nvm install 20.8.1

       nvm use 20.8.1

       node -v # output: v20.8.1
       ```

    4. You can set Node.js v20.8.1 as your default version with the following command:

       ```bash
       nvm alias default 20.8.1

       ```

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
- Redis. To install Redis on your Operating System, please follow the below guides
  - [To install Redis on Windows](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/install-redis-on-windows/)
  - [To install Redis on Linux](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/install-redis-on-linux/)
  - [To install Redis on macOS](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/install-redis-on-mac-os/)
- **(Optional)** pnpm - Needed if you want to install new packages
- **(Optional)** localstack (required only in S3 related modules)

### Setup the project

The project is a monorepo, meaning that it is a collection of multiple packages managed in the same repository.

To learn more about the project structure and running the project locally, please have a look [here](https://docs.novu.co/community-support/introduction#run-novu-locally?utm_campaign=github-contrib).
After cloning your fork, you will need to run the `npm run setup:project` command to install and build all dependencies.

To learn a detailed guide on running the project locally, checkout our guide on [how to run novu in local machine](https://docs.novu.co/community/run-in-local-machine?utm_campaign=github-contrib).

## Missing a Feature?

If a feature is missing, you can directly _request_ a new one [here](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature&template=feature_request.yml&title=%F0%9F%9A%80+Feature%3A+). You also can do the same by choosing "ðŸš€ Feature" when raising a [New Issue](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/issues/new/choose) on our GitHub Repository.
If you would like to _implement_ it, an issue with your proposal must be submitted first, to be sure that we can use it. Please consider the guidelines given below.

## Coding guidelines

To ensure consistency throughout the source code, please keep these rules in mind as you are working:

- All features or bug fixes must be tested by one or more specs (unit-tests).
- We use [Eslint default rule guide](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/), with minor changes. An automated formatter is available using prettier.

Questions, suggestions, and thoughts are most welcome. Feel free to open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/issues/new/choose). We can also be reached on our [Discord Server](https://discord.novu.co).
